                        Kerala. It is an arch dam with a double curvature and is built on River Periyar. Precisely, the
                        dam is constructed in a gorge between two hills, Kuravathi and Kuravan. It is at the height of
                        about 550 feet and is a breathtaking sight in the otherwise rugged terrain along which has been
                        built.</p>

                        second highest peak when it comes to the mountain ranges in the Western Ghat. This mountain
                        range is a trekkerâ€™s paradise in the Southern parts of India, and is located just a small
                        distance away from the beautiful Munnar town of Idukki district in Kerala. The name of the peak
                        is derived from the fact that it is made of a total of eight peaks. All of these mountains are
                        spread out and have a moustache like formation. The mountain range is sandwiched between
                        Anaimalai Hills and the Palani Hills, which are located near Suryanelli. </p>
